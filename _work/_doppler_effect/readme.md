# Sirens with a Doppler Effect
You want a tad bit more Realism for your Serversided Sounds? Then you can follow the next Steps to add an Doppler Effect to your Sirens!

Either you take the pre configured `"serversideaudio_sounds.dat54.rel"` from here and put it into the Data Folder of your SSAS Resource or you edit this file on your own to your needs with the handy Tutorial down below

## Tutorial

1. Extract the `"serversideaudio_sounds.dat54.rel"` to an XML File
2. Open the XML with Notepad++ or any similar Program
3. Search for `"<DopplerFactor value="0" />"`
4. Change that Factor to a Factor you like (You can do that by using Search and Replace | We choose 100 as Value but you can make that Lower or Higher to your Liking)
5. Save the XML
6. Activate the Edit Mode in Codewalker
7. Import the XML into CodeWalker and replace the current `"serversideaudio_sounds.dat54.rel"`
8. Enjoy your Sirens with an Doppler Effect
